Description: Generalized iLUCK-models are a way to define sets of priors based  
  on conjugate priors, with the property that the set of posteriors, obtained by
  updating each prior in the set by Bayes' rule, is still easy to handle.
  Generalized iLUCK-models belong to the domain of imprecise probability (or
  interval probability models), allow to include non-stochastic uncertainty
  ('ambiguity') in Bayesian analysis, and lead to reasonable inferences in case
  of prior-data conflict.
